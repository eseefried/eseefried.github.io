## Enginuity -- Dataset Proposal
Stemming from my work at the SNS facility at Oak Ridge, I’m excited to share that my team and I won the Dataset Proposal Competition at the AI4Science Workshop at NeurIPS this year! 🎉 This was also my first talk at a major conference, and I had the opportunity to present a poster to a packed room of researchers facing similar challenges in scientific and engineering data. Our proposal includes a call for community participation — a collaborative effort to help unlock high-value scientific datasets that are traditionally locked behind proprietary walls.

Unfortunately, my eyes look a little closed in this photo, but I’m still incredibly proud to have presented to such a large audience.

Our poster was a massive hit, drawing a constant stream of researchers and industry folks dealing with similar retrieval and documentation problems. I’m deeply grateful to have worked alongside an amazing team — my mentor Dr. Ghosal, Prahitha, Sharhitha, Tilak, and everyone from the SNS facility who supported the vision from day one.

A bit more about the poster (3–4 sentences)

The poster showcased the Enginuity initiative: a large-scale effort to build an open, richly annotated repository of engineering and scientific diagrams. We highlighted our phased data-collection strategy, combining public-domain automotive diagrams with an industry-engagement pipeline that enables contributions without exposing proprietary IP. The response was overwhelming — researchers immediately recognized the gap Enginuity fills and were eager to collaborate, contribute diagrams, or integrate the benchmark into their own workflows. The enthusiasm reaffirmed our belief that Enginuity can become a community-driven cornerstone dataset for multimodal reasoning in scientific and engineering domains.
