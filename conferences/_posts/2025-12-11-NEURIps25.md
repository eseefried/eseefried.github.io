## Enginuity -- Dataset Proposal
Stemming from my work at the SNS facility at Oak Ridge I'm happy to announce that my team and I won the dataset proposal competition at the AI4Science workshop at NeurIPS this year! Along with the award, I gave my first talk at a major conference, and presented a poster on the work as well. Our proposal includes a call for community in which we plan to collaborate with academia and research to progress and develop scientific datasets that are often proprietary. 

Unfortunatley my eyes look slightly closed in this picture, but I'm proud to have presented to such a large audience.

Our poster was a massive hit with a large stream of people with similar problems, and looking to collaborate!
