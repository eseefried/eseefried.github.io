## Enginuity -- Dataset Proposal
Stemming from my work at the SNS facility at Oak Ridge I'm happy to announce that my team and I won the dataset proposal competition at the AI4Science workshop at NeurIPS this year! Along with the award, I gave my first talk at a major conference, and presented a poster on the work as well. Our proposal includes a call for community in which we plan to collaborate with academia and research to progress and develop scientific datasets that are often proprietary.
